         <h1>The methods</h1><p>
		The methods of disposing garbage may be broadly classified as follows:
    Land Filling Dumping: - Refuse is dumped in low lying land or in land depressions like pits and hollows for reclaiming low lying land. This is the easiest method of disposing dry refuse. Bacterial action reduces the volume of the refuse and gradually converts it to humus. This method however, has the following
    Disadvantage:
            <ol>
                <li>Loose refuse may be dispersed by wind</li>
                <li> Garbage is exposed to files and rodents</li>
                <li>It is unsightly in appearance and produces an unpleasant</li>
                <li>Surface water as well as ground water may get polluted</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p><h2>Cleaning the Bins</h2>  After the bins are emptied, they should ideally be rinsed with warm and scrubbed with a long handed brush using soap and disinfectant. The floors of the disposal area should be clean and free from any spare refuse. 30 Kitchen waste and plate scraping should be collected in closed container or a stronger polythene bag or disposable cartons. To check pilferage transparent bags may be used. After the bag is full, it should be tied up. These can be directly emptied into or placed in the main bins at regular intervals. This waste should never be carried through the dining areas. The containers should always be covered and cleaned thoroughly as soon as they are empty</p>

<div class="Section7"><h1>Solid Waste</h1>
<p>Garbage or swill is the waste matter resulting from the preparation cook and consumption of food. Waste matter from preparation will include vegetable and fruit peels and trimmings, rotten food stuffs, spoilt can food, etc. cooking wastes include peels, skin and bones, charm preparations and spoilt food. Sometimes food is wasted after it is serve, plate waste also accounts for large portion garbage.
				Refuse refers to any waste material, either non-food or swill. Non-food waste from the kitchen includes all cans, bottles, paper bags, polythene items, paper napkins and straws toothpicks, etc. also contribute significantly to the overall solid waste matter. If waste is allowed to accumulate, it is dangerous to health. This is because of the following reasons:
					<ol>
						<li>Organic portions of solid waste ferment and give off foul odours.</li>
						<li>Piled up waste favours the breeding of insects and rodents especially flies.</li>
						<li>Pathogens present in waste may be conveyed to humans through pests and dust.</li>
						<li>It may pollute the water supply.</li>
						<li>There is a risk of air pollution in case of accidental or spontaneous combustion of rotting refuse because of the production of gas.</li>
						<li>Hogs, cattle and dogs feed on garbage and spread it still further.</li>
						<li>Heaps of refuse lying around is an unattractive sight.</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
                <h2>Storage of garbage</h2>
				<p>Garbage should be tilled in bins and should be kept in the coolest place. Care should be taken to ensure easy cleaning and absence of pests. The garbage storage area should be large enough for the amount of garbage that will accumulate.
					<ul>
						<li><b>The garbage bin</b> - The garbage bin should have the following characteristics:
							<ol>
								<li>It should be made of metal, preferably galvanized.</li>
								<li>Stoutly constructed and durable</li>
								<li>Painted or treated with bitumen to prevent rusting. </li>
								<li>Unrigged.</li>
								<li>Covered with tightly fitting lids, preferably with a clip to prevent the lid from blowing off.</li>
								<li>Leak proof</li>
								
					</ul>
